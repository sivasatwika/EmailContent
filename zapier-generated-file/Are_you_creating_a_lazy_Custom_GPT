# Are you creating a lazy Custom GPT?

Right now, I’m seeing a wave of Custom GPTs built from a dump of blogs, books, or podcast transcripts.

 

I get it. It’s tempting to feed all your content into a tool and hit publish.

 

But here’s the issue.

 

Each post, podcast, or book chapter is a moment-in-time idea. Together, they rarely form a cohesive, usable body of thought. 

 

What you get back is vague advice. 

Generic responses. 

Nothing that moves your client forward.

 

It’s the AI version of checkbox DEI. 

And just like performative DEI, 

it fails to deliver real outcomes.

 

What works better?

 

Start with a single, recurring problem your audience faces. 

One that eats up their time. 

One they ask you about every week.

 

Then design a GPT that solves just that.

 

Make it your assistant.

Make it so useful people talk about it when you’re not even in the room.

 

Here’s the one I’m building:
- Helps consultants identify metrics for the ROI of DEI
- Maps each answer to where they are in the journey
- Suggests next steps and sample
scorecards
- Gives formulas and visulas for real business impacts

 

Why do it?

 

Because a focused GPT is a long-term asset. 

One that boosts your offers, differentiates you and scales your expertise, without scaling your hours.

 

One that can be tuned, tailored and
trusted.

 

The bottom line is…

Most GPTs are Genric.
