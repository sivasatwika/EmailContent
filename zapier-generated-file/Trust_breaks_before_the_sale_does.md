# Trust breaks before the sale does

> “Trust doesn’t break when value drops.

> It breaks when perceived risk spikes.”
 

That line hit me hard. And it’s especially true for DEI consultants.

 

Every time you add urgency,
complexity, or pressure — you're adding risk.

Even if you don’t mean to.

 

That risk doesn’t show up as “I don’t trust your expertise.”

 

It shows up as:

→ “Let me think about it.”

→ “We need to run this by leadership.”

→ “Can we revisit this
next quarter?”

 

Sound familiar?

 

Here’s how it happens:
- Now it’s not just about value. It’s about risk
- You send a 10-page proposal with multiple options
- They stall. You lose momentum. The sale quietly dies
- A tailored strategies that doesnot resonates with client
- The buyer wants to say yes, but they now feel
uncertain

 

That’s why it is recommend to start with a Productized Service.

 
1. Fixed Price — no surprises.
2. Fixed Promise — one specific, valuable outcome.
3. Fixed Process — they know exactly what will happen, and when.

 

When your first offer feels low-risk and easy to say yes to, you build trust.

When trust is strong, then you can talk about longer-term transformation.

 

Sometimes the best way to win big later is to start small.
